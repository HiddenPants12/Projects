document.getElementById("infoText").innerHTML = `Hi, thanks for playing! This is my attempt to put <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230290/Universe_Sandbox/" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Universe Sandbox 2</a> on Steam into JavaScript. I'm pretty new to JavaScript but this has been the most fun project I have done so far. I'm a 12 year old kid who loves science (especially things like astrophysics and computer science), and wanted to make a space simulator. I took a ton of inspiration from the original game. I'm always open to tips on how I should improve the game! Here's a link to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVTyYjVBFS1ftuo__k3EtEftdYvFDL_gqv7jjOy2f34/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Google Doc</a> that shows how I built the game and some sources for pictures and stuff (because I couldn't make the stars and planets art myself).`
